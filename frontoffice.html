		<p>The library of Noakhali Science and Technology University provides friendly front officers. They assist students in borrowing books and using the lockers available in the NSTU library.  

			The Front Office is located near the entrance of the NSTU library, making it easy for students to spot as they enter.
			</p>
		<p>So, if students of Noakhali Science and Technology University want to borrow books or store their belongings in the locker, they can go to the front office.  

			Currently, two staff members are managing the front office at the NSTU library. In addition to book borrowing and locker services, students can also print their assignments here, as a dedicated printer is available.</p>
